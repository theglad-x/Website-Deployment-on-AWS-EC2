## Simple Website Deploymet on AWS EC2

This project is part of my participation in the HNG Internship. The task involves deploying a static website onto an AWS EC2 instance, configuring NGINX to serve the website, and ensuring that the website is accessible through a public IP address. The objective is to demonstrate my ability to set up and configure a web server, as well as deploy static content in a cloud environment.

In this project I deployed a simple static website on AWS EC2 using NGINX as the web server. 
The website includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files 


## Setup for the Deployment
1. Launch an EC2 instance on AWS.
2. Install NGINX on the EC2 instance.
3. Upload the website files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`) to the EC2 instance.
4. Configure NGINX to serve the website.
5. Access the website through the public IP address of the EC2 instance.
